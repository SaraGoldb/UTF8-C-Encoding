# UTF8 Encoding in C 
### Sara Goldberger

The C built-in character type `char` supports ASCII characters only, and hence has support only for Latin characters.  The modern world uses many more characters than just the Latin characters in ASCII.  Enter UTF8 â€“ this is the most commonly used character encoding format. In this project, I implement basic UTF8 support in character strings.
